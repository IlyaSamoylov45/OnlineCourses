Boyce-Codd Normal Form Part 2
  - BCNF Decomposition algorithm
    - Input : relation R and FDs for R
    - Output: decomposition of R into BCNF relations with "lossless join"
    - Computes keys for R : using FDs
    - Repeat until all keys are in BCNF :
      - Pick any R with A → B that violates BCNF
      - Decompose R into R1(A,b) and R2(A,rest)
      - Compute FDs for R1 and R2
      - Compute keys for R1 and R2
    - BCNF Decomposition Example
      - Student(SSN, sName, address, HScode, HSname, HScity, GPA, priority)
        - SSN → sName,address,GPA
        - GPA → priority
        - HSCode → HSname,HScity
        - keys : {SSN,HScode}
        - Step 1 using Student(SSN, sName, address, HScode, HSname, HScity, GPA, priority):
          - S1(HSCode,HSname,HScity)
          - S2(SSN, sName, address, HScode, GPA, priority)
        - Step 2 using S2(SSN, sName, address, HScode, GPA, priority):
          - S3(GPA, priority)
          - S4(SSN, sName, address, HScode, GPA)
        - Step 3 using S4(SSN, sName, address, HScode, GPA):
          - S5(SSN, sName, address, GPA)
          - S6(SSN, HScode)
      - Solution :
        - S1(HSCode,HSname,HScity)
        - S3(GPA, priority)
        - S5(SSN, sName, address, GPA)
        - S6(SSN, HScode)
