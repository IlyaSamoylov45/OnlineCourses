Functional Dependencies Part 5
  - Specifying FDs for a relation
    - Armstrong's Axioms
    - Want minimal set of completely nontrivial FDs such that all FDs that hold on the relation follow from the dependencies in this set
  - Functional Dependencies are generally useful concept
    - Relational Design by decomposition
      - Functional dependencies => Boyce-Codd Normal Form
      -  Data storage - compression
      - Reasoning about queries - optimization
