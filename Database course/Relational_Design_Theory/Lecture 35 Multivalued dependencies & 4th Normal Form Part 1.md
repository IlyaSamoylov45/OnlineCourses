      - R : A ↠ B for A1, ... , An and B1, ... , Bn
      - ∀t,u ∈ R
      - t[A1, A2, . . ., An] = u[A1, A2, . . ., An] then ∃v ∈ R : v[A1, A2, . . ., An] = t[A1, A2, . . ., An] and v[B1, B2, . . ., Bn] = t[B1, B2, . . ., Bn] and v[rest] = u[rest]
    - Sometimes called tuple generating dependencies
