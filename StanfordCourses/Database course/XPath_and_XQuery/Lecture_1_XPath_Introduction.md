Lecture 18 XPath Introduction
  - Querying XML
    - Not nearly as mature as Querying Relational
      - Newer
      - No underlying algebra
    - Sequence of development
      - XPath : path expressions + conditions
      - XSLT : XPath + transformations, output formatting
      - XQuery : XPath + Full-Featured Query Language
      - Others:
        - XLink
        - XPointer
  - XPath = Path expressions + conditions
    - Think of XML as a tree
    - Basic construct:
      - "/" root element separator
      - X Book
      - * Matches anything
      - @ matches attribute
      - "//" any descendant of current element
      - [c] condition ex: [@Price < 50]
    - Built in functions (Lots of them)
      - contains(s1, s2)
      - name()
    - Navigation "axes" (13 of them)
      - parent::
      - following-sibling::
      - descendents::
      - self::
  - More details
    - XPath Queries operate on and return sequences of subelements  
      - XML documents
      - XML stream
    - Sometimes result can be expressed as XML and sometimes it can't
