Functional Dependencies Part 1
  - Relation Design by Decomposition
    - "Mega" Relations + properties of data
    - System decomposes based on properties
    - Final set of relations satisfies normal form
      - No anomalies and no lost information
  - Properties and Normal Forms
    - Functional Dependencies => Boyce Codd Normal Form
    - Multivalued dependencies => Fourth Normal Form
  - Functional Dependencies are generally a useful concept
    - Data storage compression
    - Reasoning about queries - optimization
  - Example : College Application Info
    - Student(SSN,sName,address,HSCode,HSname,HScity,GPA,priority)
    - Apply(SSN,cName,state,date,major)
  - Focus on student
    - Suppose priority is determined by GPA
      - GPA > 3.8 priority 1
      - 3.3 < GPA <= 3.8 priority 2
      - GPA <= 3.3 priority 3
    - Two tuples with same GPA have same priority
      - ∀t,u ∈ student:
        - t.GPA = u.GPA → t.priority = u.priority
        - GPA → priority
      - A → B:
        - ∀t,u ∈ R
        - t.A = u.A → t.B = u.B
      - A1, A2, . . ., An → B1, B2, . . ., Bm:
        - ∀t,u ∈ R
        - t[A1, A2, . . ., An] = u[A1, A2, . . ., An] → t[B1, B2, . . ., Bn] = u[B1, B2, . . ., Bn]
  - Functional Dependency
    - Based on knowledge of real world
    - All instances of relations must adhere
