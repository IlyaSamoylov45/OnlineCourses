Multivalued dependencies & 4th Normal Form Part 3
  - Trivial Multivalued dependency  
    - A ↠ B  B ⊆ A or A U B all attributes
  - Non Trivial MVD : otherwise
  - Rules for multivalued Dependencies
    - FD is an MVD rule
      - If A → B then A ↠ B
    - Intersection rule
      - A ↠ B and A ↠ C then A ↠ B ∩ C
    - Transitive Rule
      - A ↠ B and B ↠ C then A ↠ C - B
  - Fourth Normal Form => BCNF
    - Relation R with MVDs is in 4NF if:
      - For each nontrivial A ↠ B, A is a key
  - 4NF Decomposition algorithm
    - Input : relation R + FDs for R + MVDs for R
    - Output : decomposition of R into 4NF relations with "lossless join"
    - Compute keys for R
    - Repeat until all relations are in 4NF
      - Pick any R with nontrivial A ↠ B that violates 4NF
      - Decompose R into R1(A, B) and R2(A, rest)
      - Compute FDs and MVDs for R1 and R2
      - Compute keys for R1 and R2
  - 4NF Decomposition Example 1:
    - Apply(SSN, cName, hobby)
      - SSN ↠ cName
      - No Keys
    - A1(SSN,cName) No FDs
    - A2(SSN, hobby) No MVDs
  - 4NF Decomposition Example 2:
    - Apply(SSN, cName, date, major hobby)
      - SSN, cName → date
      - SSN, cName, date ↠ major
      - No Keys
    - A1(SSN, cName, date, major)
      - A3(SSN, cName, date)
      - A4(SSN, cName, major)
    - A2(SSN, cName, date, hobby)
      - A5(SSN, cName, hobby)
    - Final : 
      - A1(SSN, cName, date)
      - A2(SSN, cName, major)
      - A3(SSN, cName, hobby)
