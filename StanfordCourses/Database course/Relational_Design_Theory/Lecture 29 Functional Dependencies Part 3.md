Functional Dependencies Part 3
  - Functional Dependencies and key
    - Relation with no duplicates R(A, B)
    - Suppose A → all attributes then it is a key since an attribute determines every other attribute
  - Vocab
    - Trivial Functional Dependency
      - A → B : B ⊆ A
    - Nontrivial Functional Dependency
      - A → B : B ⊈ A
    - Completely Nontrivial FD
      - A → B : B ⊈ A ⋂ B = ∅
  - Rules for Functional Dependencies
    - Splitting rule:
      - A1 → B1, B2, . . ., Bn => A → B1,  A → B2, . . ., A → Bn
      - We can't split the left-hand side
        - HSname, HScity → HScode
    - Combining rule
      - A → B1, A → B2, . . ., Bn => A → B1, B2, . . ., Bn
    - Trivial Dependency Rule:
      - A → B and B ⊆ A
        - A → B then  A → A U B
        - A → B then  A → A ⋂ B
    - Transitive Rule
      - A → B, B → C, then A → C
    - Closure of Attributes
      - Given relation FDs, set of attributes A
      - Find all B such that A → B
      - A+ {A1, . . . , An}+
      - Start with {A1, . . . , An} and repeat until no change
    - Closure example:
      - Student(SSN,sName,address,HSCode,HSname,HScity,GPA,priority)
        - SSN → sName,address,GPA
        - GPA → priority
        - HSCode → HSname,HScity
          - {SSN, HSCode}+ => all attributes => key
    - Closure and key
      - Is A a key for R? -> FD
        - Compute A+ If all attributes then A is a key
      - How can we find all keys given a set of FDs?
        - Consider every subset of attributes
        - A+ -> all attributes : key
