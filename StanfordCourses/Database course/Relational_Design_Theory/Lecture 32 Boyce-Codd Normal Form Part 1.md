Boyce-Codd Normal Form Part 1
  - Decomposition of a relational schema
  - Decomposition Example 1:
    - Student(SSN,sName,address,HSCode,HSname,HScity,GPA,priority)
      - S1(SSN,sName,address,HSCode,GPA,priority)
      - S2(HSCode,HSname,HScity)
  - Decomposition Example 2:
    - Student(SSN,sName,address,HSCode,HSname,HScity,GPA,priority)
      - S1(SSN,sName,address,HSCode,HSname,HScity)
      - S2(sName,HSname,GPA, priority)
  - Relational design by decomposition
    - "Mega" Relations + properties of data
    - System decomposes based on properties
    - "Good" decompositions only
      - reassembly produces original
      - lossless join property
    - Into good relations
      - BCNF
    - Boyce-Codd Normal Form
      - Relation R with FDs in BCNF if:
        - For each A → B, A is a key
      - A is a key
      - A key is value that is never duplicated across tuples
    - BCNF? Example 1:
      - Student(SSN,sName,address,HSCode,HSname,HScity,GPA,priority)
        - SSN → sName,address,GPA
        - GPA → priority
        - HSCode → HSname,HScity
      - Keys : {SSN, HSCode}
      - To determine whether its in BCNF ask ourselves : "Does every functional dependency have a key on its left-hand side?"
      - In our case No.
    - BCNF? Example 2:
      - Apply(SSN,cName,State,date,major)
        - SSN,cName,State → major, date
      - Key : {SSN,cName,State}
      - This is in BCNF since our one and only FD has its key on the left hand side.
