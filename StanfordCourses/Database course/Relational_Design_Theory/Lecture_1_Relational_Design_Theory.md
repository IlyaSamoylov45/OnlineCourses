Relational Design Theory
  - Designing a database schema
    - Usually many designs possible
    - Some are much better than others
  - Often use higher level design tools, but...
    - Some designers go straight to relations
    - Useful to understand why tools produce certain schemas
  - There is a nice theory for relational database design
  - Example: College Application Information : Apply(SSN,Sname,cName,HS,HScity,Hobby)
    - SSN and Name
    - Colleges Applying to
    - High School Attended (with city)
    - Hobbies
  - Design "Anomalies"
    - Redundancy
    - Update Anomaly : update facts differently
    - Deletion Anomaly : inadvertently delete
  - Better Design : No anomalies
    - Apply(SSN, cName)
    - Student(SSN, Sname)
    - HighSchool(SSN, HS)
    - Located(HS, HScity)
    - Hobbies(SSN, Hobby)
