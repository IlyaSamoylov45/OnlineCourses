Design by Decomposition
  - Design by Decomposition
    - "Mega" Relations + properties of data
    - System decomposes based on properties
    - Final set of relations satisfies normal form
      - No anomalies and no lost information
    - Functional Dependencies => Boyce Codd Normal Form
    - Multivalued dependencies => Fourth Normal Form
