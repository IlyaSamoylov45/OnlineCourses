  <img src= "images/UMLQUIZ4.png">
    - A) |A| = 10; |B| = 0; |C| = 0
    - B) |A| = 10; |B| = 0; |C| = 10
    - C) |A| = 10; |B| = 1; |C| = 10
    - D) |A| = 10; |B| = 20; |C| = 10
    - Solution : |A| = 10; |B| = 1; |C| = 10

  - Q8 : Suppose there is a UML superclass Movies with subclasses. Consider the following possible pairs of subclasses:
  ```
  1. {B,NB}: B = movies in which Kevin Bacon appears; NB = movies in which Kevin Bacon does not appear
  2. {B,R}: B = movies in which Kevin Bacon appears; R = movies in which Julia Roberts appears
  3. {B,K}: B = movies in which Kevin Bacon appears; K = movies in which Val Kilmer appears
  4. {L,S}: L = movies more than 100 minutes long; S = movies less than 105 minutes long
  ```
  - Consider whether each pair of subclasses is complete or incomplete (partial), and whether the pair is overlapping or disjoint (exclusive). (Depending on your knowledge, you may have to do some web searches on movies to get the right classification.) Which of the following statements is correct?
    - A) {B, NB} is complete and disjoint.
    - B) {L, S} is incomplete and disjoint.
    - C) {B, K} is incomplete and overlapping.
    - D) {B, R} is complete and disjoint.
    - Solution : {B, R} is incomplete and overlapping.
