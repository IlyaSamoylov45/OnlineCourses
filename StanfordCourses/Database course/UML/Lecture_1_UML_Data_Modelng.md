UML Data Modeling
  - Data Modeling
    - How to represent data for application
      - Relational model - with design principles
      - XML
      - Database design model
        - Not implemented by system
        - Translated into model of DBMS
  - Higher-Level Database Design Models
    - Entity-Relationship Model (E/R)
    - Unified Modeling Language (UML)
      - Data Modeling subset
    - Both are graphical
    - Both can be translated to relations automatically
      - Or semi-automatically
  - UML Data Modeling: 5 Concepts
    - Classes
    - Associations
    - Association classes
    - Subclasses
    - Composition & aggregation
  - UML Data Modeling: Classes
    - Name, attributes, methods
      - For data modeling : add "pk", drop methods
  - UML Data Modeling Association
    - Relationships between objects of two classes
    - Multiplicity of Associations
      - Relationships between objects of two classes
  - Multiplicity of Associations:
    - Types of Relationships
      - One to One
      - Many to One
      - Many to Many
      - Complete
  - UML Data Modeling : Association Classes
    - Relationships between objects of two classes with attributes on relationships
  - Eliminating Association Classes
    - Unnecessary if 0 .. 1 or 1 .. 1 multiplicity if we allow NULL
  - Self Associations
    - Associations between a class and itself
  - UML Data Modeling : Subclasses
  - Subclass & properties
    - Superclass = Generalization
    - Subclass = Specialization
    - Incomplete (Partial) v.s. Complete
      - If complete, all objects in superclass belong to one or more subclasses.
    - Disjoint (Exclusive) v.s. Overlapping
      - If disjoint, no object is in more than one subclass.
  - UML Data Modeling: Composition & Aggregation
    - Objects of one class belong to object of another class
  - High-Level Database Design
    - Unified Modeling Language (UML)
      - Data Modeling subset
    - Graphical
    - 5 concepts
      - Classes
      - Associations
      - Association classes
      - Subclasses
      - Composition & aggregation
    - Can be translated to relations automatically
