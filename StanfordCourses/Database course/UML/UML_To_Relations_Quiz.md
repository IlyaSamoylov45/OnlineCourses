UML to Relations Quiz
  - Q1 : Suppose we had 0..2 on the right-hand side, so students can apply to up to 2 colleges? Is there still a way to "fold in" the association relation in this case, or must we have a separate Applied relation?
    - Solution : Yes there is a way, We might create relation Student(sID,sName,GPA,cName1,cName2), assuming null values are allowed. We can similarly fold in any 0..N or M..N multiplicity, although the bigger N is, the less sense this translation makes.
- Q2 : Consider a superclass S with some number of subclasses. Suppose the subclassing relationship is incomplete (partial) and overlapping. Let size1, size2, and size3 denote the total number of tuples using translation schemes 1, 2, and 3. How are these three values guaranteed to be related for any data?
  - Solution : size3 <= size2 <= size1, Since the data can be empty, all sizes can be 0 so we must have = as a possibility. Translation 3 has one tuple for each object regardless of subclassing. Translation 2 has one tuple for each object, plus one more each time an object is in more than one subclass. Translation 1 has one tuple for each object, plus one more for each time an object is in a subclass.
