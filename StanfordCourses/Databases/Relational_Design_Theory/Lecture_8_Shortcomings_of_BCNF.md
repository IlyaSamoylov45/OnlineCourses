Shortcomings of BCNF
  - Boyce-Codd Normal Form
    - Relation R with FDs is in BCNF if:
      - For each A → B, A is a key
  - Fourth Normal Form
    - Relation R with MVDs is in 4NF if:
      - For each nontrivial A ↠ B, B is a key.
  - Example College application info
    - Apply(SSN, cName, major, date)
    - Can apply to each college once for one major
    - Colleges have non-overlapping application dates
      - FDs : SSN,cName → date,major, date → cName
      - Keys: SSN, cName
      - BCNF: No
        - A1(date, cName)
        - A2(SSN, date, major)
      - Good design?
        - Not necessarily.
        - 3NF better
    - 3rd Normal Form weaker than BCNF
  - Example 2
    - Student(SSN, HSname, GPA, priority)
    - Multiple HS okay
    - priority is determined by GPA
      - FDs: SSN → GPA, GPA → priority => SSN → priority
      - Keys: SSN, HSname
      - BCNF: No
        - S1(SSN, priority)
        - S2(SSN, HSname, GPA)
          - S3(SSN, HSname)
          - S4(SSN, GPA)
      - Good design?
        - Not necessarily.
  - After Decomposition there is no guarantee dependencies can be checked on decomposed relations.
  - Example 3
    - Scores(SSN, sName, SAT, ACT)
    - Multiple SAT and ACT scores are allowed
      - FDs: SSN → sName
      - Key: No key
      - MVD : SSN, sName ↠ SAT "rest" [ACT]
      - 4NF: No
        - S1(SSN, sName)
        - S2(SSN, SAT)
        - S3(SSN, ACT)
  - Example 4
    - College(cName, state)
      - cName → state
    - CollegeSize(cName, enrollment)
      - cName → enrollment
    - CollegeScores(cName, avgSAT)
      - cName → avgSAT
    - CollegeGrades(cName, avgGPA)  
      - cName → avgGPA
    - BCNF/4NF: Yes
      - Good design?
        - Not necessarily, too decomposed
  - Designing database schema
    - Usually many designs possible
    - Some are much better than others
    - How do we choose?
  - Very nice theory for relational database design
    - Normal Forms : "Good" relations
    - Design by decomposition
    - Usually intuitive and works well
