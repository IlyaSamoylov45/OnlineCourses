How Authentication Works
  - Client and server
  - Send Auth Data to server and validate.
  - The old way is using sessions.
  - The server uses restful API.
  - Client and Server are decoupled from each other.
  - Server will send Token and client stores the token which is sent to authorize subsequent requests.

Preparing the Signup Request
  - We can use firebase to make authentication requests.
  - Firebase api gives good information of authentication for email and password.
