Design by Decomposition
  - Design by Decomposition
    - Start with mega relations combining everything
    - Decompose into smaller, better relations with same information
    - Can do decomposition automatically
  - Automatic Decomposition
    - "Mega" Relations + properties of data
    - System decomposes based on properties
    - Final set of relations satisfies normal form
      - No anomalies and no lost information
  - Properties and Normal Forms
    - Functional Dependencies => Boyce Codd Normal Form
    - Multivalued dependencies => Fourth Normal Form
    - Fourth Normal form is stricter
  - Functional Dependencies and BCNF
    - Apply(SSN,sName,cName)
      - Redundancy; Update and Delete Anomalies
      - Storing SSN-sName pair once for each college
    - Functional Dependency SSN -> sName
      - Same SSN always has the same sName
      - Store each SSN's sName only once
    - Boyce-Codd Normal Form
      - If A -> B then A is a key
      - Decompose Student(SSN, sName) and Apply(SSN,cName)
