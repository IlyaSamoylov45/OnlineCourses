Boyce-Codd Normal Form Part 1
  - Decomposition of a relational schema
  - Decomposition Example 1:
    - Student(SSN,sName,address,HSCode,HSname,HScity,GPA,priority)
      - S1(SSN,sName,address,HSCode,GPA,priority)
      - S2(HSCode,HSname,HScity)
  - Decomposition Example 2:
    - Student(SSN,sName,address,HSCode,HSname,HScity,GPA,priority)
      - S1(SSN,sName,address,HSCode,HSname,HScity)
      - S2(sName,HSname,GPA, priority)
  - Relational design by decomposition
    - "Mega" Relations + properties of data
    - System decomposes based on properties
    - "Good" decompositions only
      - reassembly produces original
      - lossless join property
    - Into good relations
      - BCNF
    - Boyce-Codd Normal Form
      - Relation R with FDs in BCNF if:
        - For each A → B, A is a key
      - A is a key
      - A key is value that is never duplicated across tuples
    - BCNF? Example 1:
      - Student(SSN,sName,address,HSCode,HSname,HScity,GPA,priority)
        - SSN → sName,address,GPA
        - GPA → priority
        - HSCode → HSname,HScity
      - Keys : {SSN, HSCode}
      - To determine whether its in BCNF ask ourselves : "Does every functional dependency have a key on its left-hand side?"
      - In our case No.
    - BCNF? Example 2:
      - Apply(SSN,cName,State,date,major)
        - SSN,cName,State → major, date
      - Key : {SSN,cName,State}
      - This is in BCNF since our one and only FD has its key on the left hand side.

Boyce-Codd Normal Form Part 2
  - BCNF Decomposition algorithm
    - Input : relation R and FDs for R
    - Output: decomposition of R into BCNF relations with "lossless join"
    - Computes keys for R : using FDs
    - Repeat until all keys are in BCNF :
      - Pick any R with A → B that violates BCNF
      - Decompose R into R1(A,b) and R2(A,rest)
      - Compute FDs for R1 and R2
      - Compute keys for R1 and R2
    - BCNF Decomposition Example
      - Student(SSN, sName, address, HScode, HSname, HScity, GPA, priority)
        - SSN → sName,address,GPA
        - GPA → priority
        - HSCode → HSname,HScity
        - keys : {SSN,HScode}
        - Step 1 using Student(SSN, sName, address, HScode, HSname, HScity, GPA, priority):
          - S1(HSCode,HSname,HScity)
          - S2(SSN, sName, address, HScode, GPA, priority)
        - Step 2 using S2(SSN, sName, address, HScode, GPA, priority):
          - S3(GPA, priority)
          - S4(SSN, sName, address, HScode, GPA)
        - Step 3 using S4(SSN, sName, address, HScode, GPA):
          - S5(SSN, sName, address, GPA)
          - S6(SSN, HScode)
      - Solution :
        - S1(HSCode,HSname,HScity)
        - S3(GPA, priority)
        - S5(SSN, sName, address, GPA)
        - S6(SSN, HScode)

Boyce-Codd Normal Form Part 3
  - Computed FDs for R1 and R2 : Implied FDs, Closure
  - Pick any R with A → B that violates answer
  - Does BCNF guarantee a good decomposition? YES
    - Removes anomalies
    - Can logically reconstruct original relation
