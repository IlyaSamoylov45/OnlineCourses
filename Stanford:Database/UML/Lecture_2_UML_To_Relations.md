  - Higher Level Database Design Model
    - User friendly(graphical) specification language
    - Translated into model of DBMS
  - Unified Modeling Language UML
    - Data Modeling subset
    - 5 concepts
      - Classes
      - Associations
      - Association classes
      - Subclasses
      - Composition & aggregation
    - Designs can be translated to relations automatically

      - Subclass relations contain all attributes
      - One relation containing all superclass + subclass attributes
    - Best translation may depend on properties
  - UML to Relations : Composition & Aggregation
  - UML High Level Database Design Model
    - User friendly graphical specification language
    - Designs translated to relation automatically
