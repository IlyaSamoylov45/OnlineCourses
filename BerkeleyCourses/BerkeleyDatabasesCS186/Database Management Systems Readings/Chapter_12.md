Chapter 12.4.3 The Iterator Interface
  - A query evaluation plan is a tree of relational operators and is executed by calling the operators in some (possibly interleaved) order.
  - To simplify the code responsible for coordinating the execution of a plan, the relational operators that form the nodes of a plan tree (which is to be evaluated using pipelining) typically support a uniform iterator interface, hiding the internal implementation details of each operator.
  - The iterator interface for an operator includes the functions open, get_next, and close.
  - The open function initializes the state of the iterator by allocating buffers for its inputs and output, and is also used to pass in arguments such as; selection conditions that modify the behavior of the operator.
  - The code for the get-next function calls the get_next function on each input node and calls operator-specific code to process the input tuples. The output tuples generated by the processing are placed in the output buffer of the operator, and the state of the iterator is updated to keep track of how much input has been consumed.
  - When all output tuples have been produced through repeated calls to get_next, the close function is called to deallocate state information.
  - The iterator interface is also used to encapsulate access methods such as B+ trees and hash-based indexes.
